README
------

These are the original Quake map files as released by
John Romero in October 2006.

The original release came along with a couple of more
files but I have only selected the map files that are
included with the retail version of Quake.


BSP versions
------------

The BSP versions of these maps are available in the
'bsp' folder. These have been compiled with the
information from here:

Texture data
------------

The texture wads that have been used to compile the
maps is a fully derivative work from the "Quake
Revitalization Project":

The texture data was downscaled to their original
sizes and color mapped to the Quake palette with the
help of the ImageMagick application:

Additional notes
----------------

Compared to the retail version of Quake there are
a few differences in these map files to be aware of:

E1M2 makes use of a texture named '+1SLIPBOT'. This
texture is not available in the retail version of
Quake. It might have been removed or being changed
to use '+0SLIPBOT' instead.

E2M3 makes use of a texture named 'AZSWITCH4'. This
texture is not available in the retail version of
Quake. It might have been removed or being changed
to use 'AZSWITCH3' instead.
