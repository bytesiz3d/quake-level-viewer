// dear imgui: Platform Backend for Raylib
// (Info: Raylib is a cross-platform general purpose library for handling windows, inputs, graphics context creation, etc. using OpenGL)
// This is is the low level ImGui backend for raylib, a higher level API that matches the raylib API can be found in rlImGui.h

// You can use unmodified imgui_impl_* files in your project. See examples/ folder for examples of using this.
// Prefer including the entire imgui/ repository into your project (either as a copy or as a submodule), and only build the backends you need.
// Learn about Dear ImGui:
// - FAQ                  https://dearimgui.com/faq
// - Getting Started      https://dearimgui.com/getting-started
// - Documentation        https://dearimgui.com/docs (same as your local docs/ folder).
// - Introduction, links and more at the top of imgui.cpp
